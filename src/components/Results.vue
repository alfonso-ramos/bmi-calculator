                A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your
                chances of
                experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced
                fat
                and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular physical
                activity,
                ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.
